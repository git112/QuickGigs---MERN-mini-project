# QuickGigs (MERN Stack)

## üìò Project Overview

QuickGigs is a basic freelancing platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The platform allows two main roles: **clients** who can post freelance jobs (gigs), and **freelancers** who can view and apply to these gigs.

The application is kept simple with **no authentication or user accounts**. Freelancers interact by submitting their **name and a message** for a gig they are interested in. All data is handled through a connected backend and stored in **MongoDB**.
